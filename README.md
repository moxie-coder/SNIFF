# How does this fork differ from the OG SNIFF?

This fork adds the optimizations from HRK_EXEX's fork of SNIFF, along with a few modifications. These modifications include:
- BPM Multiplier (Useful for charting songs with a BPM higher than 522)
- Song Credits (Allows you to put a creator's name who created the song you're charting)
