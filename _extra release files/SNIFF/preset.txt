	First line is for song name, it's used for making the file name. (Default is input file name)

	Second line is for BPM. You can leave it empty only flp file was selected.

	Third line is for needsVoices, it can be Y or N. (Default is Y)

	Forth line is for player1. (Default is "bf")

	Fifth line is for player2. (Default is "dad")

	Sixth line is for gfVersion. (Default is "gf")

	Seventh line is for stage. (Default is "stage")

	Eighth line is for speed. (Default is bpm value divided by 50)
	The speed of a song of any difficulty level is set by this value.

		true // needsVoices
		bf // player1
		dad // player2
		gf // gfVersion
		stage // stage
